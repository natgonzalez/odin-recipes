        <li>Add in the garlic, dill, sage, thyme, and pepper, and cook for 2-3 more minutes until herbs are fragrant.</li>
        <li>Stir in potatoes, vegetable broth, and bay leaves, and bring to a boil. 5. Reduce heat to medium-high and simmer about 8 minutes or until potatoes are about 75 percent cooked through.</li>
